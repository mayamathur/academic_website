We investigated whether category confusion between the perceptual categories of “robot” and “human” contributes to Uncanny Valley aversion. Using a novel, validated corpus of 182 images of real robot and human faces, we precisely estimated the shape of the Uncanny Valley and the location of the perceived robot/human boundary. To implicitly measure confusion, we tracked 358 subjects’ mouse trajectories as they categorized the faces. We observed a clear Uncanny Valley and a pattern of categorization supporting a perceived categorical boundary. Yet, in contrast to predictions of the category confusion mechanism hypothesis, the Uncanny Valley and category boundary locations did not coincide, and mediation analyses further failed to support a causal role of category confusion. These results suggest category confusion does not explain the Uncanny Valley effect.","tags":[],"title":"Uncanny but not confusing:  Multisite study of perceptual category confusion in the Uncanny Valley","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maya B.

We provide user-friendly, open-source software (https://osf.io/st2ef/) for designing and analyzing such experiments online using the Qualtrics survey platform. The software consists of a Qualtrics template with embedded Javascript and CSS along with R code to clean, parse, and analyze the data. No special programming skills are required to use this software. As we discuss, this software could be readily modified for use with other online survey platforms that allow the addition of custom Javascript. We empirically validate the provided software by benchmarking its performance on previously tested stimuli in a standard category-competition experiment with realistic crowdsourced data collection.","tags":[],"title":"Open-source software for mouse-tracking in Qualtrics to measure category competition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maya B.

We consider a publication process such that “statistically significant” results are more likely to be published than negative or “nonsignificant” results by an unknown ratio, eta. Using inverse-probability weighting and robust estimation that accommodates non-normal true effects, small meta-analyses, and clustering, we develop sensitivity analyses that enable statements such as: “For publication bias to shift the observed point estimate to the null, ‘significant’ results would need to be at least 30-fold more likely to be published than negative or ‘nonsignificant' results.” Comparable statements can be made regarding shifting to a chosen non-null value or shifting the confidence interval. To aid interpretation, we describe empirical benchmarks for plausible values of eta across disciplines. We show that a worst-case meta-analytic point estimate for maximal publication bias under the selection model can be obtained simply by conducting a standard meta-analysis of only the negative and “nonsignificant” studies; this method sometimes indicates that no amount of such publication bias could “explain away” the results. We illustrate the proposed methods using real-life meta-analyses and provide an R package, PublicationBias.","tags":[],"title":"Sensitivity analysis for publication bias in meta-analyses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maya B.
